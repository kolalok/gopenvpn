gopenvpn
--------

gopenvpn is a simple graphical front-end for OpenVPN, the open source
VPN solution.

It provides a GNOME system tray icon from which OpenVPN connections can
be started and stopped, and a dialog from which OpenVPN's logs can
be viewed.  It can manage multiple simultaneous connections, and
graphically indicates when you're connected to a VPN tunnel.

onlight fork notes
------------------

The purpose of this fork is to add several features (on the "onlight" branch):

1. Allow for gopenvpn to be killed (between Gnome sessions) without
disconnecting the VPNs and then to attempt to reconnect with the various
openvpn management interfaces upon restart (when starting a new Gnome
session).  This capability has been completed.

2. Allow for gopenvpn to be used as a pre-session "openvpn launcher" in order
that the VPNs are available prior to the window manager.

Installing
----------

1. Install prerequisites

The following libraries are prerequisites:

 * glib-2.0
 * gtk+-3.0
 * libsecret (for remembering passphrases)
 * ayatana-appindicator3
 * polkit-0.96 (or newer)

The following packages are also prerequisites:

 * gedit (for editing configuration files)

2. On systems with older versions (< 0.18.1) of libgettext such as Ubuntu lucid,
   autoreconf will fail.  Update the gettext infrastructure:

   $ cd gopenvpn
   $ gettextize

   edit configure.ac and remove the extra "po/Makefile.in" in AC_CONFIG_FILES:

	AC_CONFIG_FILES([pixmaps/Makefile po/Makefile.in
			 po/Makefile.in
			 polkit/Makefile
			 src/Makefile
			 Makefile])

   so that it reads:

	AC_CONFIG_FILES([pixmaps/Makefile
			 po/Makefile.in
			 polkit/Makefile
			 src/Makefile
			 Makefile])

3. Build it

   $ cd gopenvpn
   $ autoreconf -vi
   $ ./configure
   $ make

   NOTE: autoreconf may require -f (force) if gettextize was run.

4. Install it

As root, run:
   # make install

5. To run gopenvpn on login, add /usr/local/bin/gopenvpn to your GNOME
session's startup items.

Configuration Files
-------------------

gopenvpn will look in the directory /etc/openvpn for OpenVPN configuration
files.  OpenVPN configuration files with suffixes ".conf" and ".ovpn"
are recognized.  Any configuration files found will appear in
gopenvpn's context menu.

Using gopenvpn
--------------

You can launch gopenvpn manually

  /usr/local/bin/gopenvpn

... or add it to your GNOME session's startup items so that it starts
up whenever you login to your computer.

Once gopenvpn is loaded, its system tray icon will appear.  The tray
icon appears RED when no connection is active, YELLOW when a connection
is being made, and GREEN when one or more connections is active.

Right-click on the tray icon to display the gopenvpn context menu.
The context menu lists all the VPN connections available to connect,
as determined by gopenvpn's scan of the /etc/openvpn directory
for OpenVPN configuration files.

The OpenVPN log for each connection can be viewed in the Details
dialog box, accessible from the "Details..." menu item on the context
menu.  The Details dialog box permits you to tab between connections,
reviewing the log for each, and can also connect/disconnect connections
and edit the configuration file.
